QFAMES is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently identifies clusters of closely spaced eigenvalues of quantum many-body systems and determines their **multiplicities** under physically motivated assumptions. We numerically demonstrate its performance with three models:
- toy_model: a toy model with only three eigenvalues [0, 0, 0.1]    (Z. Ding)
- TFIM: the transverse field Ising model    (Y. Yang)
- toric code: the 2D toric code model   (R. Zhang and Y. Yang)
